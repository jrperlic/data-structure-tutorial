## Introduction

The second data structure we will be looking at in this tutorial is the linked list.

A **linked list** is a [noncontiguous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/noncontiguous) list. What does that mean? It means that the elements in a linked list are not located next to each other in memory.

For example, study the line of code below:

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
```

The `fruits` list is a standard Python list. The `apple`, `banana`, and `orange` elements are located next to each other in memory. But if `fruits` was a linked list, its elements could be stored in disparate locations.

Before we move on, you should know that a linked list is organized differently from a regular list:

* Each element or **node** in a linked list contains a **value** and a link to the address of the next element.
* The first node is called the **head** and, as you might have guessed, the last node is called the **tail**.
* Some linked lists are extra fancy, maintaining a link to the next node as well as the previous node. When a linked list uses **bi-directional** linking, it is called a **doubly-linked list**.
