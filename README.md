## Introduction

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Tutorial! If you're familiar with functional programming in Python and want to improve your coding skills, then you've come to the right place.

## Overview

The following data structures are covered in this tutorial:

- [Stack](1-stack.md)
- [Linked List](2-linked-list.md)
- [Tree](3-tree.md)

There are descriptions and examples in each module. You will find a problem to solve on your own at the end of each module. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.

### What are data structures?

Put simply, data structures are the way we are able to store and retrieve data. They are _the_ fundamental building block of computer science.

You should already be familiar with Python lists and dictionaries. Both are prime examples of data structures.

### What is performance?

In computer science, performance is a measure of how long it takes code to run.

[Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) is the language we use for talking about code performance.
