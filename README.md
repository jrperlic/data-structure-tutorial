# Python Data Structure Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Data Structure Tutorial. Every beginning Python programmer should understand these basic topics:

- [Stack](1-stack.md)
- [Linked List](2-linked-list.md)
- [Tree](3-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
